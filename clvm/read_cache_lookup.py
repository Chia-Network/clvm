class ReadCacheLookup:
    """
    When deserializing a clvm object, a stack of deserialized child objects
    is created, which can be used with back-references. A `ReadCacheLookup` keeps
    track of the state of this stack and all child objects under each root
    node in the stack so that we can quickly determine if a relevant
    back-reference is available.

    In other words, if we've already serialized an object with tree hash T,
    and we encounter another object with that tree hash, we don't re-serialize
    it, but rather include a back-reference to it. This data structure lets
    us quickly determine which back-reference has the shortest path.

    Note that there is a counter. This is because the stack contains some
    child objects that are transient, and no longer appear in the stack
    at later times in the parsing. We don't want to waste time looking for
    these objects that no longer exist, so we reference-count them.

    All hashes correspond to sha256 tree hashes.
